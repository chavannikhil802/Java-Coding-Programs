Abstract Class and Abstract Method

Abstract Method:-

Abstract Method is a method which has only declaration, but no implementation.
Means, Abstract Method is only declared in the class, but there is no method body or any business logic present inside that method.
In this case, the method declaration ends with semi-colon.
eg: abstract int add(int num1, int num2);

Abstract Class:-

Abstract class is a Partially implemented class, i.e. it consists of abstract method/s, which do not have any implementation.
We can still declare a class as Abstract Class, even if it does not have any abstract methods.
However, it becomes mandatory to declare the class as Abstract if it contains even one Abstract Method.

Rules of Abstract Class and Methods:-
1 - We cannot create any object of an Abstract Class, because it is a Partially implemented Class.
2 - Since we cannot create an object of an Abstract Class, we cannot access the methods of the class directly.
3 - In order to access the Abstract Methods, we must create a Child Class of the Abstract Class.
4 - The Child Class must implement all the abstract methods of the Parent Abstract Class.
5 - We can access the Abstract Methods of Abstract Class by creating the object of the Child Class of the Parent Class.

In the following program, we have created an Abstract Class named as AbstractArithmeticFunctions, which consists of both, Abstract and Non-Abstract Methods.
We have then created a Child Class named as ArithmeticFunctions, which implements the Abstract Methods of AbstractArithmeticFunctions.
We have then created a main class, AbstractClassDemo, whic creates the object of ArithmeticFunctions to implement the Abstract Methods.
